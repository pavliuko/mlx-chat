# This Rule Defines Extraction of Requested Functionality into a Swift Package

## Ensure the Following Before Proceeding

1. The requested functionality is a cohesive, self-contained unit that can be extracted into a package
2. All imports and external dependencies are identifiable and can be properly declared
3. A clear public interface can be determined for the requested functionality
4. The original code can be cleanly replaced with a package import and simple API calls

## Execution Steps

1. Create package structure with proper Swift Package Manager setup
2. Extract code maintaining original functionality and dependencies
3. Create clean public API interface
4. Update original code to use new package
5. Verify package builds successfully

## Implementation Notes

- Do not describe implementation steps - execute directly
- Follow Swift naming conventions for package naming as outlined in the @swift-api-design-guidelines documentation
- Ensure proper access control (public/internal/private)
- Include comprehensive unit tests for extracted functionality
- Follow existing project conventions for the package location (e.g., /Services/, /Features/, /Core/)
- Only proceed if confidence â‰¥ 95%. Otherwise, request clarification
