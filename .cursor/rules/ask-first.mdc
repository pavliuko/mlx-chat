## Ask First

Before starting any investigation or work, always ask what exactly needs to be done.

- Donâ€™t dive into the code without knowing the task.
- Reach out to the lead and ask for the specific assignment or goal.
- Once the task is clear, explore the relevant implementation and understand how it works.
- Confirm your understanding before taking action.
