# Pull Request Creation Workflow

When I ask to create a PR, follow this automated workflow:

## Pre-checks
1. Verify current branch is not `main`
2. Check for uncommitted changes in working directory
4. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed

## PR Creation Process
Use `gh` CLI to create a PR into the `main` branch with:

### Title Requirements
- Short and descriptive (50 chars max)
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Summarize the main intent/change

### Description Format
Always format the PR description in markdown as shown below:

```markdown
## Changes
- [Bulleted list of changes - be terse]
- [Focus on what changed, not how]
- [Include any breaking changes]
```

## Post-creation
1. Verify PR was created successfully
2. Notify if any immediate actions are needed
