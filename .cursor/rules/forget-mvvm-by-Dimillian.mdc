# SwiftUI 2025 Architecture Rules

*(Inspired by Thomas Ricouard's article: [SwiftUI in 2025: Forget MVVM](https://dimillian.medium.com/swiftui-in-2025-forget-mvvm-262ff2bbd2ed))*


## Core Philosophy

* SwiftUI is no longer a "new" framework — it’s the default UI paradigm for Apple platforms.
* Stop applying legacy patterns designed for UIKit.
* Embrace SwiftUI’s declarative nature and native data flow.
* Focus on simplicity, co-location of logic, and clear state ownership.

---

## Architecture Principles

### 1. No Need for External Abstractions

* Avoid introducing layers between data and UI.
* Use native tools: `@State`, `@Binding`, `@Observable`, and `@Environment`.
* Let the view own and manage its state unless reuse or sharing is *actually* required.

### 2. Use SwiftUI’s Built-in State System

* `@State` → Local, ephemeral view state
* `@Observable` → Shared app or feature state (iOS 17+)
* `@ObservableObject` → Compatibility with older OS versions
* `@Binding` → Two-way binding from parent to child
* `@Environment` / `@EnvironmentObject` → For dependencies like theme, auth, routing, etc.

```swift
@State private var isEditing = false

@Observable
class AuthState {
    var isLoggedIn = false
    var user: User?
}

struct MyApp: App {
    @State private var auth = AuthState()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            LoginView()
                .environment(auth)
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 3. Follow Unidirectional Data Flow

* **State goes down, actions go up.**
* Views describe the UI; they do not own the business logic for the whole app.
* Mutate state via simple methods or property assignments, not command handlers.

```swift
struct SettingsView: View {
    @Binding var isDarkMode: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Toggle("Dark Mode", isOn: $isDarkMode)
    }
}
```

---

### 4. Lifecycle and Side Effects

* Use `.task`, `.onAppear`, `.onChange`, etc. — they are lifecycle-aware.
* Prefer `async/await` to Combine or manual callbacks.
* Avoid complex managers to coordinate view logic.

```swift
.task {
    isLoading = true
    user = try? await API.fetchUser()
    isLoading = false
}
```

---

### 5. Compose UI with Small Views

* Keep views focused and readable.
* Extract subviews for repeated or logically isolated sections.
* Use functions or separate `View` types — whatever is simplest and clearest.

```swift
var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Header()
        Content()
        Footer()
    }
}
```

---

### 6. Avoid These Anti-patterns

* ❌ Wrapping properties in external objects just to "test better"
* ❌ Moving state out of views for no good reason
* ❌ Duplicating SwiftUI's existing data flow tools
* ❌ Creating "controllers" or "managers" that mimic UIKit patterns
* ❌ Pretending SwiftUI needs to be architected like UIKit

---

### 7. Testing Strategy

* Logic belongs where it’s used. Test it in isolation.
* If shared logic emerges naturally, extract it into `@Observable` types.
* Use unit tests for logic and SwiftUI previews for visual correctness.
* Don’t force testability by complicating your architecture.

---

### 8. Async + Concurrency = First-Class Citizens

* Swift Concurrency should be your default tool for async logic.
* Use `Task {}` or `.task` in views; they integrate cleanly with the view lifecycle.
* Avoid Combine unless absolutely necessary (e.g. interop or reactive streams).

---

### 9. Organize Code by Feature

* Group files by **feature**, not by type.
* Prefer `LoginScreen.swift` over `Views/LoginView.swift` + `ViewModels/LoginVM.swift`.
* Keep logic and UI close together until duplication or complexity makes it worth extracting.

---

### 10. Examples

```swift
// ✅ Self-contained UI
struct CounterView: View {
    @State private var count = 0
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Count: \(count)")
            Button("Increment") { count += 1 }
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
// ✅ Shared state with @Observable
@Observable
class AppState {
    var isLoggedIn = false
    var user: User?

    func login(user: User) {
        self.user = user
        isLoggedIn = true
    }
}
```

```swift
// ✅ Async in view lifecycle
struct ProfileView: View {
    @State private var profile: User?
    @State private var isLoading = false
    
    var body: some View {
        Group {
            if let profile {
                Text(profile.name)
            } else if isLoading {
                ProgressView()
            }
        }
        .task {
            isLoading = true
            profile = await ProfileService.fetch()
            isLoading = false
        }
    }
}
```

SwiftUI is not UIKit. Don't try to make it behave like it is.
Let your code look like SwiftUI, not like 2015-era MVVM.
